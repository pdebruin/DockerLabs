The best way to spend time with Docker Enterprise Edition is to deploy and use it in dedicated machines. However sometimes you don't have a lab environment. Maybe your lab is too short in duration to spend time on infrastructure. Or your group is too large to provision dedicated machines for. Not to worry: there still are a few options.

* Play with Docker CE / swarm 
The first option is to start a session at play-with-docker.com. This provides you with web-based console access to one or multiple machines that 
* Docker hosted trial
The second option is to start a trial of Docker Enterprise Edition. This may take a bit longer to provision, so don't hold your breath to receive the confirmation mail. 
* PWD EE
In special cases there may be a play-with-docker environment running the Docker Enterprise Edition bits. This is sometimes arranged around big conferences, like DockerCon and Ignite 2017. 

## Build a Docker image

* Short route: use pdebruin/dotnetmvc, which is a nanoserver for ASP.NET Core image with a new ASP.NET Core MVC app on it. Or if you have your own Windows container image, feel free to use that.
