# Docker basics with Windows 

Use remote desktop connection to connect 

**Excercise 1**

Type the following command:
```
docker version
```
This is the primary command to run on any Docker environment. It tells you if Docker is installed on client and server, if it is running, what version it is running. 

Note: In Docker for Windows on Windows 10 it will also tell if the client is running to host Windows containers and Linux containers, since you have those two options.

A bit more detailed is the following command:
```
docker info
```
This command shows more details about the docker environment, including swarm, and extension points such as network, storage and plugins. 

**Exercise 2**

Let's run a first container:
```
docker run microsoft/nanoserver hostname
```
This command will check to see if your container host already has the container image, pull if from Docker Hub if needed and then run container, execute the command and exist. In this case it outputs the hostname of the container instance. You can the same command multiple times and see that the hostname is different every time, so actually new container instances are created.

If you just want to download the image without running, do: 
```
docker pull microsoft/nanoserver
```
To speed up the labs this should ideally be done before the lab or let's hope you have a solid internet connection. 

To see what container images you have on your host, type:
```
docker images
```
This lists the images with tag, id, age and size. You could use `docker tag <image id> <tag name>` to give an image a tag and use `docker rmi <image id or name>` to remove the image completely or you can continu the lab in a predictable way. 

**Exercise 3**

To see what containers are currently active, type:
```
docker ps
```
This list does not contain any of the above since you have only created short-living containers, but let's change that. Type:
```
docker run -d -p 80:80 microsoft/iis
```
What happens now is that the microsoft iis image is pulled, started, in detached mode (-d) and the internal image port 80 is exposed externally at port 80 (-p 80:80). When you type `docker ps` again you will actually see your container is still running. Docker works with its own software defined networking. To find the ip address of your container, type:
```
docker inspect <container name or id>
```
In the output you will see the ipaddress and now you can browse to http://<ipaddress>. (Or add the port number if you did not use 80.) This should show the default IIS start page. 

It is also interesting to log in to a container and see what it can and can't do. 
```
docker exec -i <container name or id> cmd 
```
or when it is not running 
```
docker run -it microsoft/nanoserver cmd
```
You could now make changes to the image, exit the container, commit the changes to a new image and (re)use that. The preferred way to create new images in a repeatable and automated way is by using a docker file.

**Exercise 4**

The final step in a build cycle is to push an image to a registry. Everyone can use Docker Hub at http://hub.docker.com. Make sure you have your own credentials (not provided in this lab) to log in and make sure to create a new repository called something like mynanoserver. 

Since we did not build a new image, let's reuse an existing one:
```
docker tag microsoft/nanoserver <your docker id>/mynanoserver
```

Now you can login from the commandline through
```
docker login
```
use your own credentials here. Next you can upload the image to the repository:
```
docker push <your docker id>/mynanoserver
```

All done: You have downloaded a Microsoft provided image, run it, renamed it, and uploaded it to your own location.
